# Screen Saver

This project started because I wanted to try implementing physics using javascript. I wanted to code a galton board onto my website. Well, as it turns out, that's a pretty complicated thing to make.

Since I don't really have a firm understanding of how to implement physics using javascript yet, I decided that this is a good way to get some practice in for doing that. In this screen saver, you can add a bunch of balls to the screen and they'll all be bouncing around the screen. The physics is implemented correctly (I think) so that when two balls collide, they bounce off in the correct speed and direction. The collision formula assumes that all balls have the same mass and that the collision is elastic.

# Potential Issues:
- Depending on the frame rate, the collisions and ball movement might be a bit buggy.
- I have no idea if the code works correctly or not when three balls collide. It's kinda hard to test and I'm not bothered enought to test it.

# Hope you enjoy my screen saver!
